# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker solution

IP tracking technologies are very useful to easily search, find, track and trace the location along with other subtle information not only of your public IP but other publicly accessible IPs and domains in the world.

In this project I implement these functionalities using the IPify and LeafletJS APIs.

N/B: Disable adblockers on the browser for optimum performance.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Scss/Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
- Git and GitHub
- LeafletJS
- IPify


### What I learnt

- Reinforced my knowledge of page layouts and resonsive web design.
- Practiced more asynchronous JS working with two different apis
- Practiced more functional programming.
- Learnt more about validation for ipv4/ipv6, & domain name using regex.
- Ways to Fix the “Failed to Load Resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT” Error.

### Continued development

Continue building out awesome web applications. Learn more about HTML forms and regular expressions.
